# Heart_Disease
A client in the health sector has approached to run a proof of concept – they want to use our expertise on data-driven decision making to improve their detection and diagnosis of heart disease. They are interested to know how data, analytics, and in particular machine learning can help them   1.    Detect at risk patients at a low per-patient cost    2.    Diagnose heart disease as “well” as possible The client hopes to work through the problem together – but they’ve given a sample of their data for us to illustrate what our expertise can deliver for them. They don’t expect our work to be perfect nor comprehensive, but we hope convey understanding of the problem, the data, and a rough solution to the early detection and accurate diagnosis of heart disease.
